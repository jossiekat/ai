A "distutils.cfg" has been written to:
  /usr/local/opt/pypy3/libexec/lib-python/3/distutils
specifying the install-scripts folder as:
  /usr/local/share/pypy3

If you install Python packages via "pypy3 setup.py install", easy_install_pypy3,
or pip_pypy3, any provided scripts will go into the install-scripts folder
above, so you may want to add it to your PATH *after* /usr/local/bin
so you don't overwrite tools from CPython.

Setuptools and pip have been installed, so you can use easy_install_pypy3 and
pip_pypy3.
To update pip and setuptools between pypy3 releases, run:
    pip_pypy3 install --upgrade pip setuptools
